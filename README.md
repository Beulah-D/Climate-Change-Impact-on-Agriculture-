# CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT ON AGRICULTURE 

## Overview 
 ### Objective:
   - This project aims to provide actionable insights into the impact of climate change on agriculture by analyzing critical factors, including economic impact, crop yield, fertilizer and        pesticide usage, CO2 emissions, and adaptation strategies. The dashboard enables users to explore how various regions and crop types are affected by climate variables over time,             leveraging interactive features like filters, drill-through navigation, and dynamic visualizations to support deeper analysis and anomaly detection.
 ### Audience:
  - Designed for agriculture analysts, environmental scientists, and decision-makers aiming to uncover relationships between climate variables and agricultural outcomes, identify high-risk      regions, and optimize agricultural practices for sustainability.

  - Size: 10,000 rows x 15 columns
  - Key Variables: Crop Yield, Fertilizer Use, Pesticide Use, CO2 Emissions, Soil Health, Precipitation, and Adaptation Strategies.
  - Dataset Link: [Kaggle Dataset - Climate Change Impact on Agriculture](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/climate-change-impact-on-agriculture)
 
## Tools Used:
Tableau
- Data Cleaning: Prepared data by handling missing values, standardizing variables, and creating calculated fields.
- Geospatial Analysis: Mapped agricultural performance at the country and regional levels.
- Visualizations: Designed diverse charts (scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps) to support decision-making.
- KPI Dashboards: Summarized high-level metrics like crop yield, CO2 emissions, and pesticide use for quick insights.
- Interactive Features: Implemented filters, drill-through navigation, and tooltips for a seamless user experience.

## Key Features and Insights of Main Dashboard
 1. Geospatial Analysis:
     - Created an interactive map to visualize agricultural outputs and crop yields across countries and regions.
     - Identified high-performing areas and regions at risk due to climate change.
 2. KPI Indicators:
     - Designed high-level metrics (e.g., crop yield, fertilizer use, irrigation access) for decision-makers to gain a quick overview of agricultural performance.
 3. Trend and Time-Series Analysis:
     - Analyzed changes in fertilizer and pesticide use, crop yields, and CO2 emissions over time to uncover historical trends and predict future outcomes.
 4. Adaptation Strategy Analysis:
     - Visualized the effectiveness of various adaptation strategies (e.g., crop rotation, drought-resistant crops) using heatmaps.
     - Identified the best-performing strategies for different regions.
 5. Crop Analysis by Region:
     - Used pie charts and tables to depict the distribution of crops by region, helping assess regional specialization and diversification.
 6. Soil Health Analysis:
     - Examined soil health indicators through bar charts, enabling sustainable agricultural planning.
 
## Key Features of Crop Analysis Dashboard 
  1. Crop Yield Trends: Displays average crop yield per hectare over the years for the selected crop type.
  2. Pesticide and Fertilizer Usage: Highlights historical trends in agricultural input usage.
  3. Environmental Impact: Analyzes CO2 emissions and precipitation trends to evaluate their impact on crop yields.
  4. Factor Correlation: Scatter plots reveal the relationship between yield and key factors like soil health and precipitation.
  5. Adaptation Strategies: Breaks down crop yield performance under strategies like water management and drought-resistant crops.
  6. Filters: Allows users to dynamically explore data by country, year, and adaptation strategy for customized insights.
 
## Conclusion
This project successfully integrates climate, agricultural, and geospatial data into a single, interactive dashboard, enabling users to:
- Identify trends and anomalies in agricultural performance.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of adaptation strategies.
- Make data-driven decisions to improve crop yields, sustainability, and resilience to climate change.
